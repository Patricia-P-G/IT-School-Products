# IT-School-Products
This is my React E-commerce App project, developed as part of my web development course. The app is a simple online store that allows users to explore online games, add them to a shopping cart, and save them to favorites. It uses an external API to fetch product data, including images, prices, and details. Users can also switch between light and dark themes for a personalized experience.

The project is deployed here: https://it-school-products.netlify.app/
